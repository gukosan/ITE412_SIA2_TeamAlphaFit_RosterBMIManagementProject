SYSTEM OBJECTIVES
  The AlphaFit: A Cloud-Based Roster Management System with Individual BMI Tracking and Insights for RCEU MIMAROPA aims to address inefficiencies in roster management and health monitoring within the unit. Currently, data is managed manually or through fragmented systems, resulting in delays, inaccuracies, and limited accessibility.
  The objectives of the system are:
    1. To provide a centralized and secure platform for roster management and health data monitoring.
    2. To integrate BMI tracking and analysis, enabling automated calculations, trend monitoring, and personalized health insights.
    3. To improve operational efficiency, reducing the time needed for report generation and increasing the accuracy of health records.
    4. To support evidence-based decision-making by delivering clear health dashboards and comprehensive reports.
    5. To ensure scalability and reliability by deploying the system on a cloud-based infrastructure.

PROPOSED SCOPE
The project will cover the following modules and integrations:
  1. User Management & Authentication – secure login and role-based access for Administrators, Staff, Medical Officers, and Personnel.
  2. Roster Management – encoding, updating, and maintaining personnel roster data.
  3. BMI Tracking & Analysis – automated computation of BMI, storage of historical data, and generation of insights.
  4.Health Profile Dashboard – visual representation of BMI trends, health metrics, and personalized insights.
  5.Report Generation – automated creation of NSU-compliant reports and consolidated data outputs.
  6. Audit Logs – activity tracking for accountability and transparency.
  7. Cloud Deployment – ensure data availability, backup, and scalability.
     
Limitations of the initial scope include:
  1. Focus only on RCEU MIMAROPA as the pilot group.
  2. Limited to roster management and BMI modules during the first phase.
  3.Possible challenges in adoption due to resource constraints, training needs, and data migration.


STAKEHOLDERS
  1. RCEU Administrators – oversee roster data, verify accuracy, generate reports, and manage user access.
  2. Medical Officers – update BMI data, validate health information, and ensure accurate health monitoring.
  3. Personnel (End-Users) – view personal roster information, monitor BMI trends, and access insights.
  4. (Secondary stakeholders: Project team, IT staff for deployment & maintenance, and the wider PNP organization for possible future adoption.)
